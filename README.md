# Spam Classifier
This is a small project made to classify mails as spam or ham using the Naive Baye's Classifier.<br/>
Following are the steps to use the classifier:<br/>
1.Firstly, run ham_classifier.py and spam_classifier.py to create the dictionary of words mapped to the  corresponding conditional probabilities which is in turn stored in the two text files. <br/>
2.To test the algorithm on the testing dataset, run testing.py file. <br/>
3. To test the algo on a mail, replace the contents of the file with the mail and run tester2.py.
